This project demonstrates how to build a sidebar navigation component in Vue 3 and convert it into pure JavaScript for broader compatibility. The real-world problem this addresses was originally solved at a logistics company. However, due to NDA constraints, specific details can't be disclosed. This repo serves as a practical example.
